### About Me
I'm Linux Gamer; I'm an artist (digital, pixel, and animator), gamer, content creator (Twitch and YouTube), programmer and game developer.
I enjoy doing most of my art digitally (at the moment, I am enjoying doing a lot of Pixel Art stuff (using Libresprite) and also drawing digitally (using Krita). For my coding, I use either VS Code or Kate. For gamedev, I use Godot or pygame.
I am British, so I speak fluent English, but I'm currently learning Welsh and Dutch.
I contribute to Libresprite and work on my own projects like Pynotes.
